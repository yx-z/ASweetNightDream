# A Sweet Night Dream
A small story (about 10 min) that describes one's dream in words.
And I turned words to a **visual novel**.

Just enter the link above and enjoy(hopefully lol).

Also, I have set some save points so don't worry if 10 min still sounds too long for you :)

<del>Note: due to Chrome's web security concern, this visual novel/game can be played only in Firefox, Safari and other supported browsers.</del>
