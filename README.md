Play it online!

Using a Chrome Desktop is preferred.

A small story (about 10 min) that describes one's dream in words.
And I turned words to a **visual novel**.

Just enter the link above and enjoy(hopefully lol).

Also, I have set some save points so don't worry if 10 min still sounds too long for you :)
